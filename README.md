# RecipeSharingApp

I recently developed a recipe sharing app using Angular for the UI and Spring Boot for the backend. The app allows users to share their culinary creations with the world.

To achieve this, I used the following technologies:

Angular: I used Angular to build the user interface of the app. Angular provides a powerful and flexible framework for building web applications.

Spring Boot: I used Spring Boot as the backend framework. Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications that you can "just run".

Spring Security: I implemented Spring Security to secure user data and ensure only authenticated users can access certain features.

JWT Authentication: I used JWT authentication to secure user data and ensure only authenticated users can access certain features.
